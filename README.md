# Facial_Recognition_Model
A Face Recognition Model detects, extracts, and classifies faces using OpenCV for face detection, deep learning models like FaceNet or Dlib for feature extraction, and classifiers like SVM or KNN for matching. It's used in security, identity verification, and attendance systems, ensuring efficient and accurate face recognition.
